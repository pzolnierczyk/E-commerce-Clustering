## E-commerce data exploration

#### Task description:
***
The goal is to explore provided data, understand it, create visualisations and make deductions of its nature.

Initially the idea was to create various analyses using the dataset, as it had a big potential. Unfortunately, the EDA shows that the data is very limited. Many promising variables are either low-detailed or anonymized, which is understable as the data was shared publicly on the Internet. This, however, does not allow to drive trustworthy conculsions and it is explained in consecutive steps of the EDA why certain approches are senseless.  

#### Data:
***
The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. It was provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil, which allows them to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.

The dataset is available publicly under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Further information can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce.
